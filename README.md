## Temple Covid Tracker

A tiny python script to extract Covid data from the html table in [Temple University's reporting page]("https://www.temple.edu/life-temple/health-wellness/coronavirus-planning-safe-return/university-communication/active-covid-19-cases-temple-university") and reformat it as JSON as well as dump it into a LevelDB instance for exposing as a time-series.
